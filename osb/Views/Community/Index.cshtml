        <p>There's often a high learning curve for a newbie getting into storyboarding. If you're stuck with a problem, it can be pretty frustrating when there's no one to ask for help, or if there isn't any good documentation online. That's where OSB comes in. We're primarily a Discord server whose main goal is to help and collaborate with others to make the best visual animations osu! has ever seen. Well, that, and have a shrine for Hifumi.</p>
        <p>Do you like storyboards on osu!? Do you want to learn how to make your own? Do you want to improve your storyboarding? Do you want to just worship Hifumi? Feel free to come by our Discord server.</p>
